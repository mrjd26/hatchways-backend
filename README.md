I used node-fetch instead of express, just run it like a node script, 'node posts.js'  -> it logs to console

I didn't understand where to find a list of all available tags.  It doesnt seem to be in the instructions.

If I could understand where all possible tags are located I could refactor my code (i hardcoded into a 'tagList' array all the 

tags i found from just looking at the api in a browser and finding some )


My code works locally. I tested in Python IDLE with the output data and got same result

Thanks
